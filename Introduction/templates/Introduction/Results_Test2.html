            Your answer is <b>correct</b>. <br>
            Since more than 20 points were put into the pool, the pool does not break down.<br>
            The 21 points in the pool are doubled to 42 and then equally split between all three players. <br>
            In total you would receive 19 points because you remained with 5 points and received another 14 points from the pool. <br><br>
            Next, you can make the actual decision in the game.<br>
