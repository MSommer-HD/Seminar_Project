           The instructions are as follows: <br><br>
        There are {{ players }} players.<br>
        Every player has 10 points. There is a common pool which is empty at the start. Every player can decide how many points
        they want to put into the common pool.<br><br>
        After all players made a decision, the points in the pool will be multiplied by {{ factor }} and every player
        receives an equal share out of the pool.<br>
        Your <b>payoff</b> will then be the amount you have kept plus your share from the pool.<br><br>
        
        Unfortunately, the points will only be doubled and get paid out if at least <b>2/3 of all points (20)</b> are in the common pool. <br>
        If there are not enough points in the pool it will break down and you will loose the points you put in the pool.
        Your payoff will then be the amount of points you have kept.<br>
        The <b>more points</b> you get paid at the end, the <b>more money</b> you win.
