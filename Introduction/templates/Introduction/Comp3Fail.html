Unfortunately, you did not pass the quiz. You needed more than 3 attempts to answer all seven questions correctly. Passing the quiz within at most three tries is a requirement for this task as explained in the HIT description.<br><br>

To avoid the HIT being rejected, we suggest to return the HIT on Mechanical Turk.<br><br>

Thank you for your participation.<br><br>
